A. We wanted the total number of coordinates touched to be the same for every tuple "(N, M)" we benchmarked. We chose the size to be the value of the largest object size (2^24). We found by analyizing the code the formula for number of coordinates touched is N * M. Thus, as the object size decreases, the number of iterations increases. For example, we ran the object size of 2^8 for 2^16 iterations.

B. We ran the largest object size (2^24) for one iteration. This took about 46 seconds. We wanted the smaller object sizes to run at least this long as well, for a statistically stable mean. For example, for the object size of 2^8, because it took approximately 6 seconds to run, we took the median of 8 test values. We found that it took till N = 2^20, M = 2^4 before it took us less than 6 test values implying an underlying exponential function.
